## Dans Rural Service Pack
My inspiration behind this pack was when I was making small towns around my city, I wanted small local options for services without having massive buildings in a small town, yeah the recycling center is pushing it (Opps).

Hope you Enjoy!

## Added Assets:
* Rural Police Station (5 police cars, 3 jail cells, low maintenance costs)
* Rural Medical Centre (2 ambulances, 10 hospital beds, low maintenance costs)
* Rural Recycling Centre (2 Rubbish/Recycling Trucks, low maintenance costs)
* Rural Post Office (4 Post vans, low maintenance costs)
* Rural Welfare Office (Low maintenance costs)
* Rural Fire Station - Low Maintenance Costs, Upgradable Watch Tower and Helipad (1 Helicopter)
